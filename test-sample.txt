Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning - Uses labeled data to train models
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finds patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learns through trial and error

Applications:
- Image Recognition
- Natural Language Processing
- Recommendation Systems
- Autonomous Vehicles

Key Concepts:
- Training Data: The dataset used to train the model
- Features: Input variables used for prediction
- Labels: Output values in supervised learning
- Model: The mathematical representation learned from data
- Overfitting: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data

Conclusion:
Machine learning is transforming industries by enabling computers to make intelligent decisions based on data patterns.
